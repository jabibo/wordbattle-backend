# WordBattle Backend - Robust Deployment Guide

## Overview

The WordBattle backend now includes a robust deployment script that ensures reliable deployments to the testing environment with comprehensive automated testing.

## Deployment Scripts

### Primary Script: `deploy-test-robust.sh`

**New robust deployment script with the following features:**

- ✅ **Robust Git handling**: Safely handles any commit messages, including those with quotes and special characters
- ✅ **Testing environment only**: Always deploys to the testing environment (`wordbattle-backend-test`)
- ✅ **Automated testing**: Runs comprehensive API test suite after deployment
- ✅ **Comprehensive verification**: Tests authentication, games API, user registration, and admin security
- ✅ **Detailed reporting**: Provides clear deployment status and test results

### Backup Script: `deploy-test.sh`

Updated to use the robust deployment script by default, with fallback to the original method.

## Usage

### Quick Deployment with Testing

```bash
# Deploy to testing environment with automated testing
./deploy-test-robust.sh
```

### Alternative Methods

```bash
# Via the updated deploy-test.sh (recommended)
./deploy-test.sh

# Legacy method (not recommended due to git message issues)
./deploy-gcp-production.sh testing
```

## Features

### 🛡️ Robust Git Integration

- **Safe commit message handling**: Escapes quotes and special characters
- **Allows uncommitted changes**: Perfect for testing environment
- **Comprehensive git info**: Shows branch, commit, author, and date
- **No git checkout required**: Works from any branch

### 🚀 Automated Deployment

- **Docker build optimization**: Proper argument ordering and label handling
- **GCP Cloud Run deployment**: Configured specifically for testing environment
- **Environment variables**: Automatically sets `TESTING=1`, `DEBUG=true`, etc.
- **Database connection**: Uses testing database (`wordbattle_test`)

### 🧪 Comprehensive Testing

After deployment, the script automatically runs:

1. **Health Check**: Verifies application is running
2. **API Documentation**: Confirms OpenAPI docs are accessible
3. **Authentication Testing**: Tests JWT token creation and validation
4. **Games API Testing**: Verifies game-related endpoints
5. **User Registration**: Tests public endpoint functionality
6. **Admin Security**: Confirms admin endpoints are protected

### 📊 Detailed Reporting

The script provides comprehensive output including:

- Git commit information
- Docker build and push status
- Cloud Run deployment details
- Health check results
- API test results
- Service URLs and documentation links

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Set Automatically

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=testing
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
DEBUG=true
TESTING=1
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://wordbattle:wordbattle123@/wordbattle_test?host=/cloudsql/wordbattle-1748668162:europe-west1:wordbattle-db
GIT_COMMIT=<current-commit>
GIT_BRANCH=<current-branch>
DEPLOY_TIMESTAMP=<deployment-time>
```

### Cloud Run Configuration

- **Service**: `wordbattle-backend-test`
- **Region**: `europe-west1`
- **Resources**: 1 CPU, 1GB RAM
- **Scaling**: 0-10 instances (cost-optimized)
- **Database**: Connected to Cloud SQL testing database

## Prerequisites

1. **Google Cloud CLI** installed and authenticated
2. **Docker** installed and running
3. **Git repository** (script extracts commit information)
4. **Proper GCP permissions** for the project

## Output Example

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop
2. **GCP authentication**: Run `gcloud auth login`
3. **Project permissions**: Ensure you have Cloud Run Admin role
4. **Git repository issues**: Run from the project root directory

### Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling and will:
- Exit immediately on any deployment failure
- Provide clear error messages
- Verify prerequisites before starting
- Test deployment success before proceeding to API tests

## Integration with Development Workflow

This robust deployment script is designed to work with the WordBattle development workflow:

1. **Development**: Make changes on any branch
2. **Testing**: Run `./deploy-test-robust.sh` to deploy and test
3. **Verification**: Automated tests confirm functionality
4. **Production**: When ready, merge to main for production deployment

## Security

- **Testing environment only**: Never deploys to production
- **Admin endpoint protection**: Verifies unauthorized access is blocked
- **Token validation**: Tests JWT authentication security
- **Database isolation**: Uses separate testing database
