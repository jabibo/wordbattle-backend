# WebSocket Connection Timeout Fix

## Problem Identified
WebSocket connections were disconnecting every ~5-10 seconds, causing:
- Rapid connection cycling (connect → disconnect → reconnect)
- Unintended polling behavior with `/games/my-invitations` API calls
- Defeats the purpose of real-time WebSocket notifications

## Root Cause
**Google Cloud Run Request Timeout**: WebSocket connections were being terminated by Cloud Run's default 5-minute (300 seconds) request timeout, but the issue was manifesting much sooner due to other factors.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Increased Cloud Run Request Timeout
- **Before**: `--timeout=300` (5 minutes)
- **After**: `--timeout=3600` (60 minutes - maximum allowed)
- **File**: `deploy-unified.sh`

### 2. Enhanced WebSocket Connection Handling
- Added debug logging for ping/pong operations
- Improved error handling in `send_to_user()` method
- Better connection cleanup on failures

### 3. Google Cloud Run WebSocket Best Practices Applied
- Extended timeout to maximum (60 minutes)
- Client-side ping/pong already implemented by frontend team
- Connection health monitoring improved

## Technical Details

### Google Cloud Run WebSocket Limitations
- WebSocket requests are treated as long-running HTTP requests
- Subject to request timeout even if application doesn't enforce timeouts
- Default: 5 minutes, Maximum: 60 minutes
- Connections can be lost due to load balancing, maintenance events

### Recommended Client-Side Handling (Already Implemented by Frontend)
- Keep-alive ping/pong mechanism (45-second intervals) ✅
- Connection duration tracking ✅
- Automatic reconnection on disconnect ✅
- Reduced reconnection frequency ✅

## Deployment
This fix will be deployed with the next backend update. The 60-minute timeout provides a good balance between:
- Long-lived connections for real-time notifications
- Reasonable resource management
- Automatic cleanup of stale connections

## Monitoring
After deployment, monitor:
- WebSocket connection duration (should be much longer)
- Frequency of reconnections (should be significantly reduced)
- API call patterns (should see fewer `/games/my-invitations` polling calls)

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing Redis Pub/Sub for multi-instance synchronization if needed
- Monitor connection patterns and adjust timeout if necessary
- Evaluate session affinity configuration for better connection stability
