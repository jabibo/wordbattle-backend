  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-variant files and
  # their corresponding resolution-aware asset bundle. For example:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list of font asset to family mappings. For example, with the first
  # font, the "family" key is "Raleway", and the "fonts" key is a list
  # with one entry for the font asset and its weight. For a complete
  # reference, see the design guide at
  # https://flutter.dev/go/font-declaration
